== JSON Indexing Models

As discussed in <<comparing-indexing-models>>, SIREn encodes a JSON object into an internal tree model. However,
there can be multiple ways to map a JSON object to a tree, each one with its pros and cons.
This section presents the different models that are currently available in SIREn. Understanding the mapping model is
important to write meaningful queries.

=== Extended Model

The extended indexing model provides the greatest flexibility amongst the models.
In this model, there is no difference between an attribute name and an attribute value. Both are textual content that
can be analyzed and searched. It becomes possible to use full-text search on the attribute name (something that is not
possible in a Lucene-based system).
This is particularly useful when dealing with data with complex attribute names. For example in RDF or JSON-LD datasets,
attribute names are URIs, e.g., `http://schema.org/givenName`, which are not very friendly to query by end-users. It is
generally preferable to analyze such attribute names and index multiple variations of them, e.g., the full URI, the local name:
`givenName`, a tokenized version of the local name: `given name`, etc., so that users have the choice of using
full-text search on attribute names.

The extended indexing model maps the above JSON object to the tree model shown in <<extended-indexing-model>>.
Every single attribute, primitive value, nested object and nested array is mapped to one node in the tree.
For example, the attributes `name`, `location` and `fundings` is mapped to their own respective node. The primitive
value of the attribute `name` is represented by a single child node of the corresponding attribute node. A nested
object, for example the one from the `location` attribute, is represented by an intermediate "blank" node.
An attribute associated to an array is represented as a node with multiple child
nodes, one child node per value in the array. In the case of nested arrays, one nested array is represented by a blank
node with one or more child nodes. For example, each of the
nested objects from the attribute `fundings` will be mapped to an intermediate blank node, children of the
corresponding attribute node.

=== Concise Model

The concise indexing model gives up some flexibility for an increase in performance. This model is combining the
<<field-based-indexing-model, field-based indexing>> approach of Lucene with the tree model of SIREn.
This provides a boost of performance for attribute or path-based queries, in exchange of the ability to perform
full-text search on the attribute name.

The concise indexing model maps the previous JSON object to the tree model shown in <<concise-indexing-model>>.
In this model, each attribute-value and attribute-object pair is mapped to a single node. In the case of an
attribute-value pair, the attribute name is concatenated with the primitive value associated to it. For example, the
attribute `name` is concatenated to the value `Radar Network` within a single node `name : Radar Network`.
In the case of an attribute-object pair, the blank node representing the object as in the extended model is merged
with the attribute node into a single intermediate attribute node. To be able to distinguish between multiple objects
in an array, it duplicates the intermediate attribute node for each attribute-object pair. For example, each of the
nested object of the `fundings` attribute is mapped to an intermediate attribute node `fundings`.
